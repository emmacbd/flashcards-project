# FlashCards!

### Abstract
Welcome to Flashcards!

With this game you can answer a series of code-related questions through the terminal. This project used JavaScript and TDD to create a game that is played entirely through the command line.

The basic flow of this game is:
- The user is prompted with a question and a series of possible answers.
- The user then selects the answer they believe is correct.
- The game will inform the user if the answer was correct of not.
- The game will prompt a user with another question until the user has answered every question in the deck.
- When the game is over, the user will see a message providing the percentage of questions they answered correctly.
